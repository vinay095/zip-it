-- Compression and Encryption Tool --

This is a simple Compression and Encryption Tool built with Python and Tkinter. The tool allows users to compress files into a ZIP archive and encrypt them with AES encryption, as well as decrypt and decompress the encrypted ZIP files. It is useful for securely storing and transmitting sensitive data.

Features
- File Compression: Compress any selected file into a ZIP archive using DEFLATE algorithm.
  ( DEFLATE is a widely-used lossless data compression algorithm that combines the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding )
- AES Encryption: Encrypt the ZIP file using a symmetric key (generated by cryptography.fernet).
- File Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted ZIP file.
- File Decompression: Decompress the decrypted ZIP file and restore the original file.
- Key Management: Automatically generates and stores a secret key for encryption and decryption.
